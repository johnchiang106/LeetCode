v1:
1. find the shortest 2 strings
2. see the prefix of them
3. see if all the strings have those prefix
v2:
1. see the prefix of the first 2 strings
2. see if all the strings have those prefix
(v2 is pretty much as fast as v1)
fast solution:
1. sort the vector
2. see the prefix of the first string and the last string
